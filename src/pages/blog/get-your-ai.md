Yes, I selected a passage of text in this document.

No, I don't want you to rephrase it for me.

No, I don't want you to explain it for me.

No, I don't want you to improve its grammar.

Frankly, I just wanted to copy this text to my clipboard.
And I'm sick and tired of all these apps aggressively shoving their useless AI features in my face every chance they get.

I mean, there are genuine use cases for LLMs in which they are super practical.
But as the AI hype train is choo-chooing ahead with full steam,
every company feels like they must stick something AI-based into their product, no matter what.
So they find a way, however unnecessary it may be.

This feels like the return of Clippy, if I'm being honest.
Popping up on your screen, offering unsolicited help, taking away focus from the actual features you want to use.
Only this time it comes with more rainbow gradients and sparkle emojis.
